# Crimemap

Interactive crime map that allows users to tag locations with details of witnessed or experienced criminal activities. The user should be able to submit new crimes by choosing a location for the map and entering a date, category, and description of the crime. The user should also be able to view all the previously recorded crimes as icons on the map and more details about any specific crime by selecting the relevant icon from the map. The point of the map is to be able to easily view areas with high crime rates as well as to assist investigators in detecting patterns and trends in crime.
